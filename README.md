# Gobal IE -never too late
An website project from Team B6 of IE 2020S1
## Introduction
We want to help women in the age range of 50-65 understand the nutritional content of their diet by building a website 
that offers 3 steps to help them analyse their diet, receive recommendation on what to eat and locate places where they 
can find ingredients for the food we recommend.
